# Convolutional-Cellular-Automaton-with-Multiple-Fields-CCAMF-
Multi-Field Convolutional Cellular Automata (MFCCA) explores complex simulations using multiple interacting fields and convolutional kernels. It aims to simulate dynamic behaviors like waves, collisions, and gravity, providing a flexible 2D sandbox for emergent phenomena with real-time interaction and customization.
